# spindragon

Something that may become an amazing Spin compiler someday.

## Why?

I want to develop a new compiler to address shortcomings in existing compilers. However, I've never made a compiler before so it may be a long time before that happens.

### Design goals:

- Recursive descent parser
- Written in Qt/C++
- Portable LLVM backend
- Library and CLI interfaces
- Modular design
- Expanded Spin functionality

### Progress:

- [x] Create project
- [ ] Add tokenizer
- [ ] Add AST
- [ ] Pretty printer
- [ ] Documentation printer
- [ ] Code generation
